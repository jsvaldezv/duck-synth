# Duck Synth: Additive Synthesizer Plugin

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9796310d-daf3-4112-a200-b8f9bc37deb6

This project is a synthesizer plugin developed in C++ using the JUCE framework. The main goal is to recreate a basic form of additive synthesis by combining two independent oscillators, allowing users to explore sound design through the layering of simple waveforms.

🎛️ Key Features:

- Additive synthesis with two oscillators
- Waveform selection: sine, square, and triangle
- ADSR envelope control to shape the amplitude over time
- Reverb effect processing using JUCE’s juce::dsp module
- Output gain control with a final volume slider
